Update 1.0. INITIAL LAUNCH
    * Launched with all sites and navigation working.

Update 1.1. Flow Update
    * Improved UI.

Update 1.2. - Services and Portfolio update
    * Added Services Page.
    * Added Navbar.html to call it to save line space across all .html files. Can now implement and update the single file to add newer tabs. 
    * Added 4 Portfolio Placeholders and connected them to the image so users can click on it, enlarge the photo and it opens in a new tab. 
    * Made UX improvement to the index page, the image should stretch across all platform instead of having white in the middle.

Update 1.3. - About and Portfolio update.
    * Updated the about to provide more detail about myself to look more credible to future employers.
    * Updated Portfolio slightly to properly match the pages.
    * Updated home about section to properly match about section.

Update 1.4. - Services card and Socials Update.
    * Updated the Services page with cards to describe prices and what they entail, still placeholder text until I decide on prices/services.
    * Updated the footer to re-include the social media logos with working links. Only LinkedIn is fully functional for now.
    * Test pending to see if small navbar is updated on Mobile after push.
